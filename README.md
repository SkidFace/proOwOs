# ProtogenOS

Hello to any random onlookers! This is a heavily modified version of Feronium's protogen firmware! I did not make the base code. This is merely a simplified version tailored to my needs, and it is far from done. It utilizes an Arduino Nano and 14 I2C LED matrices, along with other accessory components such as buttons, an IR distance sensor, and a sound sensor. I will be posting pictures when I have the chance.
